 <h3> I first came up with the codes for this website after learning all the basic html needs that are needed such as attributes,
elements, styles and more.Then, I used visual studio code as my text editor to write out all the codes.Initially,index which became my home page
and then subsequently added on the 'about','contact' and 'project' pages.Then, within the project page, I separated the page into 4 subpages to the 4 main topics in digfab.I then formed a css code 
in which I used to add in the background images, colours, font sizing, font family and all the accessories needed to  
 make the webpage more appealing. Lastly, I transferred all my files onto github so that I can store my data there and keep updating it. </h3>
